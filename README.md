# py-shit-post
A simple program in Python, which reads lines from a text file, and outputs (in console) a newly arranged tweet or shit-post.

read_buffer.txt contains 11 Donald Trump quotes, which make for some very solid hilarity.
WARNING: the program doesn't run correctly without at least a couple of lines in read_buffer.txt

write_buffer.txt is all of the "associations" made from reading "read_buffer.txt

EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:

"in regarding radical Islamic terrorist know it! the impact to impact on Rubio teamed Ted Cruz great"
